Battleships
===========

Creating battleships game - Makers Academy week 4 project



# The Game

The player and his opponent place a defined number of ships of various lengths on a board made from 10 x 10 cells. Two ships cannot be placed in neighboring cells. The aim is to sink all of the opponent's ships before yours are sunk.

Once the ships have been placed, the players take turns in selecting cells on their opponent's board to attack. If the attacked cell was empty, the cell is marked as failed hit. If the attacked cell had a ship placed on it, the hit is successful. If all the cells of a ship are hit, the ship is sunk. Once all the ships of a player are sunk, the game is over and his opponent is the winner!
